					<h1>Elisha Bird</h1>
					<p>I was a very successful freelance illustrator and designer in 2001 with clients in the fashion, toy, print, and advertising industries. However, the 9/11 attacks forced many of my clients to go out of business. I pivoted to teaching- which led me to incorporate Curriculum Development and Instructional Design skills to teach Photoshop, HTML, and CSS at CUNY. I also taught basic Java/JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and Ruby-On-Rails. My goal now is to accelerate my skill development in web development and to integrate my skills in art and design to create tools that people use to make their lives better and/or more entertaining.</p>

					<p>My goal is now to accelerate my skills and progress in web development and to integrate my skills in art and design to create tools that aid people in learning difficult skills like programming.</p>
